 GitaNib of our Campus is a social history show about which about 50 talks are available in English and each talk is either discussing a specific Buddha or a complete study of a specific Buddha. GitaNib is presented in parallel with that of my book "No Boundaries", published in 1987. GitaNib does not focus on moral issues but on the habits of modern life. Go to http://gita.org for more information and to book recommendations. For more about GitaNib and its work in particular, as well as events relating to its consideration, see: http://www.gita.org/about-all-people-on-the-internet. All Rights Reserved.
