 The National Education Agency (NAEA) is a public interest law firm committed to making a good investigation good law. We seek to understand what our law actually says about our nation, and to discover what actually matters when it comes to justice and education in the classroom. We discuss and review new evidence when it comes to how the law affects our nation, and report to the White House on any developments in the case. Look for details on what we're doing over the next year at  whatlearnlaw.org/the-nga-online-learning-app/
