description: 
 A new 360-degree panoramic view of Manhattan National Park, from the West Coast to the East Coast. Based on the 10 Civil Aviation Centers (CACs) of the United States and the International Association of National Parks, the Center assembles a new National Park to provide a place to observe and learn. Each Park encompasses roughly 42,000 acres (one acre as a whole) in a total acreage of about 18,000 acres (equal to about 15% of New York City). Each Park also includes a National Archives (including the &c), a Greenwich Harbor Archive (the Greenwich Museum), the Pennsylvania House Museum, and the Penn State Library. Because the Center assembles about 200,000 acres (about 8% of New York City) a year, it is important for the discussion to take place in an accessible, accessible location to as close a context as possible to the original source. For example, a more accessible location at the Greenwich Quarter would result in a more accessible landscape where the general public can interact with a little more about the National Parks. Consequently, the Panoramic View brings perspectives not just of New York City itself, but also of the region as a whole. In addition, the Center also seeks to inform and inspire educational programs affecting the assessment of park programs; assess New York City's perceived environment; inform and promote the importance of park experiences on park evaluation, and address perceived risks of park existence.  Recent works include efforts to improve park diversity and designate more parks for study; emphasize park perspectives as important for research; and emphasize that park perceptions matter.
