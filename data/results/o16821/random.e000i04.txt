 "I present to you a set of experiences that each member of our group exhibits that are invaluable to our society. I have spent my life learning about how the world is different from me and how it has affected me for many decades. The following examples illustrate those experiences, as well as some suggestions for how you can begin your own growing community of friends, students, and acquaintances with our world of creativity and exploration. These are stories of connections and lessons that include many commonalities and issues. Included in this set of experiences is a few words, more info below."


"How to work with others to create experiences for others on the same level as you. Exemplify the kind of person you are, and how this will be beneficial to you."
