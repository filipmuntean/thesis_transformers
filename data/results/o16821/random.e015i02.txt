description: 
 Featured Host Ali Al-Goodin is a retired army intelligence officer and noted author who has devoted his entire career to the study of US history. He was awarded a PhD degree in military intelligence from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in 1968. In 1975, in Arafat & The Jews (a podcast about biographies), online critics will be free to write a new show about this book series. Although published annually, The Jews will be published several times a year. These episodes serve a similar purpose: inform and inspire. They're not about the book or his intended audience, but rather about the setting, the style and people who are creating that climate. Al-Goodin conducted 91 interviews in Las Vegas over the years. Now, let me ask you this: what does the story tell us about the world we inhabit? And why do we tolerate it? In each episode, we'll be looking at the events shaping our world and shedding light on it. Thank you to Mike for bringing this to podcast form.
