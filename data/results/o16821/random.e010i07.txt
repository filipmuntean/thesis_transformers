 The story you've been told before, now played straight. The story that's been told time and again. This podcast is all new material for the full setup and all the takes along the way. It gets much better as the season goes on and the new discovery comes to light that the Mysterious Files are real. It also gets a complete look at the journal of one of the characters, Dr. Joseph Latchek. The 538 characters are hand-picked by the staff and handpicked by the readers so that what happened here is explained to you in front of a modern monitor. The podcast doesn't throw back the mystery. It just magnifies the experience along the way. The depth and perspective that Andy and I share is ideal for a story where you can go back and explore even when you've been caged. The podcast doesn't go in-depth on the details, but it does go into depth on the experience of going back and exploring the weird place where the podcast took me. I want to see a whole lot more. I hope you like it. Check me out. I hope you like the show. I hope you like what I do. I promise, I want to. I promise! Please leave me a rating. I really mean it when I say it's mine, because I'm trying to be funny and not have the balls to go through all this garbage waiting to go through it all. It's like the same kind of podcast Andy and I were drinking when I was drunk, just a bit more. I hope you do. Thank you for supporting my journey into weirdness. - David Lynch
