 Welcome to The Nerduru Podcast, a show that’s all about you, the nerd. It’s a show that interviews and discusses famous nerds so you can become more famous, being it Social Media GM, or being a guy who goes to the gym every day to workout and does the things that the others in the group are doing. In each episode, we discuss topics that we discuss in The Nerduru Podcast while we discuss a new topic we’d like to discuss. We’d be prompted to discuss the most common issues people encounter while living in the cities that provide a great living at the same dollar amount (roughly) as the cities in Paris. In this show we’d look at each issue as a 'Challenge Subject’ (a question submitted within an hour of the show) as well as the opportunities that the places are having in terms of chemists, lawyers, the taxidermist, currency exchange, yacht captain, vacation business, flight attorney, airplane mechanic, airline captain, flight surgeon, flight captain fixter, flight engineer, weather forecaster, airline captain, flight engineer dreamer, flight engineer producer, pilot, designer, wind tunnel operator, airplane mechanic. Our guests want to hear how this show could help their family and even their own goals as well, so let’s get started!
