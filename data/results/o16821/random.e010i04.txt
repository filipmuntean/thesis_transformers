 First Unitarian Universalist Society of San Francisco Sunday worship service sermon at San Francisco Community Services Church. My name is Brian Brown. I am a Christian man in my 20's who reveres God and love. I've been at this church for far too long. I've met Jesus Christ and followed him to his death and on his final hill near Napa Valley. He reminded me of the man I used to be and reminded me of the man I used to call a "god." Our conversation about religion and cults began when Brian started listening and understanding the oft forgotten language of his roots. The deep insight into my own faith and roots came through his introduction of this sermon by his mentor and archdeacon, Dr. John S. Brown.This was a first for my gathering at this church and it became my first home at this community.This is my first sermon at This First Unitarian Universalist Society of San Francisco. His first speech at this event was titled This First Unitarian Universalist Society of San Francisco. This first sermon was delivered in full English as it was sung during the first meeting. It went very fast and beautifully. The first two minutes were really sweet and I couldn't finish the sentence. It made me go over to my thoughts, and as it turned out I didn't care much for the word "god." I'd better go to my words and give my heart and life my all.He went on to call the meeting "The Ceremonial Process" and it did that for me.
