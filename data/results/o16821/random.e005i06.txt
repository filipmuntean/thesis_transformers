 The Story of the Boy, is a collection of stories and storiestellers who share about the paranormal. In 2013, the phenomenon of anomalous super-entity known as life outside of the physical world was given new life as "the mind of man." This new mind, known as Man, is faster and more powerful than the physical body and much faster than any magic of knowledge. The shock of Man's power and courage strikes fear into the hearts of even the most ordinary citizens. Yet the Boy does not frighten the minds of men and boys everywhere, nor does Man give the fright to all men, no matter how far they may have traveled.

Eve seems to remember too well how on her return the ship is not under sail for her but just with her at the place where Adam went.
