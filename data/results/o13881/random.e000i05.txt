2/1<|endoftext|>SADELINES, Fla. â€” Dr. Julie Visconti, the lead author of a study looking at the effects of racial and ethnic identity on weight and health, is being criticized as being biased in favor of white doctors.

The University of Central Florida, based on a 2007 study of 265 Caucasian and ethnic minority men in clinics in Columbus and Atlanta, concluded that medical practices that recognized the health status of the minority ethnic group would lower a person's risk of fatal cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, both of which had been noted before the study.

Visconti, director of the Columbia Mening Center, says that she is "trying to bring to light the evidence and to increase awareness of the diseases that results from racial and ethnic differences in weight, in both sexes and in different individuals."

"It is very difficult to get a scientific analysis that shows if our decisions to label as [white] people would have an effect on the prevalence of a disease or on obesity or diabetes," she said.

"There is a racial and ethnic bias that persists in medicine," Visconti said, who says that as African-Americans in Florida become more likely to have diabetes, obesity and heart disease, their health status will likely decrease.

Dr. Timothy Siegelman, the president of the University of California at San Francisco who helped draft the U.S. Dietary Guidelines as health counsel to health officials, says the findings sound like common sense and contribute to the industry's early acceptance of the nomenclature, but as he says, "We should be aware that, and really make use of what we know."
