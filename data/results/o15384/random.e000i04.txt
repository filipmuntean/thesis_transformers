SHARE. The prosecution brought in the case of Yvonne Vauser, accused of rape in 2002, over a mandatory prison sentence of 19 months. The Judge agreed that based on the testimony of the victim, Vauser might not have been convicted of the rape if she was removed from the Johnson's Enterprise Correctional Institution and sent to SOURCE to serve out the remainder of her sentence, but she did eventually enter an organized plea against her sentence in the second annual Waco City University Inmate Decision Task Force hearing at CTA Center in Roanoke, Texas in December.

During the Monday evening session, PIGFREC Director Debra Wilson, State Attorney Anita J., announced on behalf of the State of Nevada that the DA's Office of Criminal Investigation has completed its cross examination into Ms. Vauser's death, testifying that their investigation showed that she had been sexually assaulted by a high school student in 1971 and that there were actual witnesses to the crime as well as reasonable and credible, (1) the handbook about investigation by the DALLAS MIAMI SECOND OFFENSIVE COURT of January 2, 1982 entitled "THE QUESTIONS THAT MUST BE PROCEDEDICTED," through the PIGFREC's PCI--Persistent Crime Records, which relates to the case presented in the Trials Chamber--and the Office of the State's Assistant Attorney General at the time of the commission of the complaint by PIGFREC, (2) several sworn statements given to the investigative teams by the investigative and prosecution teams, and (3) several other corroborating information provided by independent agents under the Waco City Police Department General Information Center. (3)

During the sentencing phase, PIGFREC has determined that the issue regarding the punishment (for all a minimum 5 years of imprisonment plus 3 additional years of community service or pay) to which Ms. Vauser was admitted is presented without due regard to the fact that the sexual offense occurred, and maintains that any, while remaining a high degree of guilt, could result in incarceration. (4) The prosecution's file at CTA Center entitled: "Q: Question for DECISION" included the following claim on June 22, 1990: "This.... is very concerning to me, as I don't even know what was said or the nature of the offence."
